* Introduction

Typographic, colors and layout for code, web, texinfo and dead tree
publication.

* Colors in Charts, Graphs & Diagrams

Define color palettes for graphic materials

We want to ensure that colors used across the project are:

  - consistent :: provides a uniform color scheme
  - aesthetic  :: is pleasant to look at -- good design
  - informative :: uses color to convey meaning
  - color-blind friendly :: this is a much larger audience
       than you might expect

** Normative Color Palette

If this was Bebop, our color Palette would be a theme that
you continually repeat, but never quite the same way twice,
riffing and pushing the envelope, but still staying within
the theme.  If you look at the source code for the diagrams
on the site you'll see that the base colors are within the
palette, but there are gradients another riffs on the colors
that bring them to life.

** Color-blind friendly colors

These are both /very/ good links that will give you more
information about thinking about color schemes than you will
/ever/ want to know.

#+begin_src
# The palette with grey:
cbPalette <- c("#999999", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

# The palette with black:
cbbPalette <- c("#000000", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#009E73", "#F0E442", "#0072B2", "#D55E00", "#CC79A7")

# To use for fills, add
  scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette)

# To use for line and point colors, add
  scale_colour_manual(values=cbPalette)

* Display of text

 - Headings

 - links
 - visited links
 - hover
 - mouse-over

 - keyboard
 - example

 - warning text
 - comment text
 - informative notes

* Font families

Quote from Beatrice... 

  - /monospace fonts/ for text screen displays
  - /proportional fonts/ for web and print




* Line Lengths

Believe it or not this is /very/ important on a number of
fronts:

  - avoid fatigue :: the brain has to strain reading lines
       with more tha 14 or so words.
  - keep plain text readable ::
* Indentation: Tabs vs Spaces 

Another contentious, topic

Basically, our stance is -- no tabs.  A long justification
will follow.

The same will go for data files, no Tab Separated Values --
use commas and get over having to escape them.

* Spaces between sentences

The typewriter 2-space, vs 1 space flame-war. Yet another
long justification will follow.

* Whitespace

The concept of whitespace being significant or not.

* Line Breaks 

Use Unix -- not Windows....

* Prose Lists

A comma after the last item before 'and' -- more flame bait
:(

* English Spelling & Vocabulary

American or English -- when to use, and if not when to
gloss.
